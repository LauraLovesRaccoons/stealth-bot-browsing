/*** READ.ME ***/

these are needed absolutely!
run these in your terminal
npm i puppeteer
npm install puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth puppeteer-extra

also a hint, use prime numbers for wait functions and browser width and height
also to run it in the terminal you have to be in the project folder
npm start

also the folder node_modules is not hosted on my github, just create a new project
looking into .gitignore makes you wiser
